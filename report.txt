Pseudocode description:

INITIALISE:
    Capital = 1000
    Position Open = False
    Position Type = None
    Theta = some threshold (e.g., 0.005)
    For each price in dataset:
    
        IF DC↑ and no position is open:
            Open Long Position
            Record entry price and time
            Calculate take-profit and stop-loss levels

        IF DC↓ and no position is open:
            Open Short Position
            Record entry price and time
            Calculate take-profit and stop-loss levels

        IF a position is open:
            IF long and price >= TP or <= SL:
                Close long position
                Calculate profit
                Record trade info

            IF short and price <= TP or >= SL:
                Close short position
                Calculate profit
                Record trade info

OUTPUT:
    List of trades with entry/exit/PnL
    Performance metrics (win rate, total return, etc.)

Intrinsic time
Directional change

Downloading and cleaning data

Introduce short selling
Backtesting and training vs test set
Used the training set to adjust values of theta

Empirical results discussion section:

Talk about fraction of total wealth invested per trade
Scalability of strategy in real life 
Talk about other potential modifcations ie. tailing stop loss
Potential to use fractions for delta up and down too so that the strategy is robust for many FX swap rates
